                        Carl Raabe assumes no liability for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against Carl Raabe relating to material or immaterial damage caused by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information are fundamentally excluded, unless there is evidence of wilful intent or gross negligence on the part of Carl Raabe.<br><br>
                        <span class="font-rubikBold">References and links</span><br>
                        In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites (hyperlinks) that lie outside the area of responsibility of Carl Raabe, a liability obligation would only come into force in the event that Carl Raabe is aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for it to prevent use in the event of illegal content.<br>
                        Carl Raabe hereby expressly declares that no illegal content was recognisable on the linked pages at the time the links were created. Carl Raabe has no influence over the current and future design, content or authorship of the linked/connected pages. Therefore, he hereby expressly distances himself from all content of all linked pages that were changed after the link was created. This statement applies to all links and references set within the own Internet offer. Liability for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information lies solely with the provider of the page to which reference is made, not with the person who merely refers to the respective publication via links.
